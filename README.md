# 📝 Java Notes App (File Storage)

## 📌 Project Description
The **Java Notes App** is a console-based application that allows users to create and view text notes.  
Notes are stored in a **text file** (`notes.txt`), so they remain available even after the program is closed.  
The app provides a **simple menu-driven interface** and uses **file handling** to read/write notes.
